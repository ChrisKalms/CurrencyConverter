    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <h4>Connect to Data Source</h4>
      <p>Go to https://fixer.io/signup/free and fill in the prompts. <br>
        After getting your free API key, go to Settings -> API KEY, and add the key to the text field.
      </p>
    <h4>Getting Data</h4>
      <p>To load data from the api, open the menu and select the 'Update' button.<br>
          NOTE: The free fixer API only updates every hour, so to save you going over your monthly
          limit, the application will only allow you to update every 30 minutes. Trying to update more
          often will prompt a popup stating "Currencies are up to date".<br>
        After loading data, go to Settings -> Choose Conversion Time, and select the top result
        to bring the loaded data into the Application. <br>
          NOTE: The application saves the currencies each time you update. If for some reason you
          need to access a previous conversion time you may do so here and it will be loaded into
          the application for you.
      </p>
    <h4>Selecting Currencies</h4>
      <p>To select the relevant currencies to convert between, go to Settings -> Choose Currencies, and
        choose all of the currencies that you need to convert between. <br>
          NOTE: If there are no codes selected, the application will default to AUD and USD.
      </p>
    <h4>Converting</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Put value to convert into input field</li>
        <li>Select the code to convert from in first picker</li>
        <li>Select the code to convert to in second picker</li>
        <li>Select the Convert button</li>
        <li>Output field will be filled with the converted value</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>
              "No Data Available" : The database has not been filled, and so the application has no
              data to work with. You need to select 'Update' button in the menu.
          </li>
          <li>
              "Cannot retrieve data" : The application is unable to get data. There are two possible causes
              for this issue.
              <ol>
                  <li>The API Key hasn't been added to the Settings or is wrong. You need to add
                      or fix the API key so that it can connect to the data source.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      The application doesn't have access to the internet. Check your phones mobile data
                      or wifi is connected.
                  </li>
              </ol>
          </li>
      </ul>
